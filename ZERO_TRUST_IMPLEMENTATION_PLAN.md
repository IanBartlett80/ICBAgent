# Zero Trust Assessment Implementation Plan
# Based on Invoke-ZTAssessment Excel Analysis - UPDATED with Permission Approval System

## ðŸŽ‰ NEW FEATURE: Intelligent Permission Approval System

### Overview
The Zero Trust Assessment now includes an intelligent permission approval system that seamlessly handles Microsoft Graph permission requirements during security assessments.

### Key Features Implemented:
- âœ… **Automatic Permission Detection** - Detects missing permissions during data collection

- âœ… **Contextual Permission Mapping** - Specific permissions for each data type
- âœ… **Seamless Assessment Continuation** - Automatic retry after permission approval
- âœ… **Read-Only Security Model** - All permissions are read-only for security assessments
- âœ… **Comprehensive Documentation** - Full guide for IT professionals

### Permission Categories:
- **Identity Assessment**: `User.Read.All`, `Directory.Read.All`, `Policy.Read.All`
- **Device Management**: `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`, `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- **Applications**: `Application.Read.All`, `Group.Read.All`
- **Infrastructure**: `RoleManagement.Read.Directory`, `Domain.Read.All`, `Organization.Read.All`
