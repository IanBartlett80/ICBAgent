## 📖 Writing Style Examples

### ✅ Good MSP Tone:
```
This month, we reviewed your license allocation and identified 
that 15% of your Microsoft 365 licenses remain unassigned. This 
represents approximately $3,000 in underutilized resources annually. 
We also observed that your Teams usage has increased by 20%, 
indicating strong adoption of collaboration tools.
```

### ✅ Good Priority with Rationale:
```
1. [High Priority] Implement Multi-Factor Authentication for all 
   admin accounts
   
   Estimated Effort: 2-3 hours
   
   This priority has been identified as critical to improving your 
   overall identity posture. Admin accounts without MFA present a 
   significant security vulnerability that could lead to unauthorized 
   access and data breaches. Recent industry trends show that 80% of 
   breaches involve compromised credentials, making MFA one of the 
   most effective security controls available.
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Testing:
1. Create test screenshots with proper naming (I_test.png, S_test.png, E_test.png)
2. Generate a sample report to verify formatting
3. Review the generated Word document for:
   - Correct section order
   - Centered images without titles
   - Detailed Comments sections
   - Priority Areas with rationale
   - Call to Actions with top 9 priorities
   - MSP tone throughout

### For Production:
1. Ensure screenshot naming convention is followed
2. Configure OpenAI API key if not already set
3. Run the report generation workflow
4. Review the output document before sharing with clients
