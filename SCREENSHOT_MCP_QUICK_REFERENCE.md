## MCP Commands Quick Reference

### Navigate + Screenshot (No Scroll)
```javascript
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({ url: 'https://...' });
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({ time: 5 });
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'path.jpg',
  type: 'jpeg',
  fullPage: true
});
```

### Navigate + Scroll + Screenshot
```javascript
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({ url: 'https://...' });
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({ time: 5 });
await mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate({
  function: '() => { window.scrollBy(0, 500); }'
});
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({ time: 3 });
await mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot({
  filename: 'path.jpg',
  type: 'jpeg',
  fullPage: false
});
```

### Text Extraction (Monthly Summary)
```javascript
await mcp_playwright_browser_navigate({ url: 'https://security.microsoft.com' });
await mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for({ time: 5 });
const snapshot = await mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot({});
// Extract text from snapshot for direct report inclusion
```

## Critical Success Factors

### ‚úÖ Must-Have
1. **Authentication**: User must sign in before any captures
2. **Wait Times**: Allow full page load before actions
3. **Scroll Timing**: Wait 3 seconds after each scroll
4. **Top 10 Focus**: AI must analyze only first 10 vulnerabilities
5. **Text Extraction**: Monthly Summary must be text, not screenshot

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls
1. Not waiting long enough for dynamic content
2. Scrolling before page fully loads
3. Taking full-page screenshots after scrolling (should be viewport)
4. Missing the text extraction for Monthly Summary
5. Analyzing all vulnerabilities instead of just top 10

### üéØ Quality Checks
- [ ] All 20 sections captured
- [ ] Images are clear and readable
- [ ] Correct sections are visible in each screenshot
- [ ] Monthly Summary text is extracted
- [ ] Top 10 vulnerabilities are properly identified
- [ ] File names follow naming convention
- [ ] Output directory is properly structured

## Scroll Amount Reference

| Scroll Distance | Sections Using This Distance |
|-----------------|------------------------------|
| 0px (no scroll) | 1, 2, 6, 12, 15 |
| 300px | 3, 7, 16 |
| 400px | 13 |
| 500px | 4, 8, 17 |
| 700px | 5, 9, 14, 18 |
| 900px | 10, 19 |
| 1100px | 11, 20 |

## Section Naming Convention

```
<portal>_<category>_<subsection>_<timestamp>.jpg
```

Examples:
- `entra_licenses_1696176000000.jpg`
- `vuln_mgmt_top_10_recommendations_1696176000001.jpg`
- `security_reports_detections_blocked_1696176000002.jpg`
- `device_health_sensor_health_1696176000003.jpg`
- `monthly_security_secure_score_1696176000004.jpg`

Special:
- `monthly_security_summary_text.json` (extracted text)

## AI Analysis Guidelines

### Section 6: Top 10 Vulnerabilities
```
CRITICAL: Analyze ONLY the first 10 rows in the recommendations table.

For each vulnerability (1-10):
1. Identify the vulnerability name
2. Assess the severity and exposure impact
3. Determine affected devices/assets
4. Provide step-by-step remediation guidance
5. Estimate time/effort required

DO NOT analyze vulnerabilities beyond position 10.
```

### Section 15: Monthly Summary Text
```
USAGE: Embed extracted text directly in report.

Format:
---
Microsoft 365 Monthly Security Summary:
[EXTRACTED TEXT CONTENT]
---

AI Commentary:
[Your analysis of the summary]
```

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Content not visible | Increase wait time from 5s to 10s |
| Wrong section in screenshot | Adjust scroll amount ¬±100px |
| Blurry screenshots | Use `fullPage: false` after scrolling |
| Missing sections | Check navigation path and wait times |
| Authentication fails | Verify permissions and retry MFA |

## Testing One-Liner

```bash
node -e "const s = require('./services/playwright-screenshot-service-mcp.js'); new s().captureAllPortalScreenshots(p => console.log(p)).then(r => console.log(r.instructions.portals.length + ' sections ready'));"
```

Expected output: `20 sections ready`
