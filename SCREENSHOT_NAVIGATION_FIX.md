# Screenshot Service Update - Automated Navigation Fix

**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Issue**: Screenshots were only capturing landing pages, not navigating to specific reports

## Problem Identified

The Playwright service was returning MCP instructions but not executing them. The root cause:

1. **MCP Service** (`playwright-screenshot-service-mcp.js`) - Returns instructions only, doesn't execute
2. **Local Service** (`playwright-screenshot-service-local.js`) - Actually executes browser automation
3. **Issue**: Local service was using deep-link URLs that don't work reliably with Azure portal hash-based routing

## Solution Implemented

Updated `playwright-screenshot-service-local.js` to use **step-by-step UI navigation** instead of deep-link URLs:

### Navigation Strategy
- ✅ Navigate to portal base URL
- ✅ Click through menus like a real user (Billing > Licenses > All Products)
- ✅ Wait for page loads and dynamic content
- ✅ Scroll to specific sections when needed
- ✅ Capture viewport screenshots for scrolled sections
- ✅ Extract text for Monthly Security Summary

### 20 Sections Captured

1. **Entra Licenses** - Navigate through Billing > Licenses > All Products
2-6. **Vulnerability Management** - Dashboard sections + Top 10 Recommendations
7-11. **Security Reports** - General security metrics with scroll navigation
12-14. **Device Health** - Sensor, OS, Windows versions
15-20. **Monthly Security Report** - Summary text extraction + 5 screenshot sections

### Key Improvements

1. **Real User Navigation**: Uses `.click()` on text elements instead of relying on fragile deep-link URLs
2. **Safe Click Method**: Error handling for missing elements, continues if navigation already happened
3. **Progressive Scrolling**: Precise scroll amounts (300px, 500px, 700px, 900px, 1100px) per section
4. **Text Extraction**: Monthly Summary content extracted separately for direct report inclusion
5. **Error Resilience**: Continues capturing even if individual sections fail

### Technical Details

```javascript
// Example: Navigation to Entra Licenses
await this.page.goto('https://entra.microsoft.com', { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' });
await this.page.waitForTimeout(5000);
await this.safeClick('text=Billing', 'Billing menu');
await this.page.waitForTimeout(2000);
await this.safeClick('text=Licenses', 'Licenses submenu');
await this.page.waitForTimeout(2000);
await this.safeClick('text=All products', 'All Products');
await this.page.waitForTimeout(5000);
await this.captureScreenshot({ section: 'entra_licenses', ... });
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Run Health Report Generation**
2. **Watch Browser Window** - You'll see actual navigation happening
3. **Verify 20 Screenshots** - Check output directory for all sections
4. **Review Screenshots** - Ensure they show actual reports, not landing pages

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

If the automated approach still has issues with specific portals:

### Option A: Adjust Wait Times
Some portals may be slower. Increase wait times from 3-5 seconds to 8-10 seconds.

### Option B: Add Specific Element Waits
Wait for specific elements to appear before capturing:
```javascript
await this.page.waitForSelector('div[data-reportname="licenses"]', { timeout: 10000 });
```

### Option C: Manual Capture Fallback
Implement a hybrid approach:
- Automated capture for most sections
- Manual capture button for problematic sections
- Save manually captured screenshots to same output directory

## Commit Message

```
fix: implement step-by-step navigation for automated screenshot capture

Problem: Screenshots were only capturing portal landing pages because
deep-link URLs don't work reliably with Azure portal hash-based routing.

Solution: Updated playwright-screenshot-service-local.js to navigate
through portal UIs like a real user, clicking through menus and scrolling
to specific sections.

Changes:
- Replaced deep-link URLs with step-by-step menu navigation
- Added safeClick() method with error handling
- Implemented progressive scrolling for multi-section pages
- Added text extraction for Monthly Security Summary
- Expanded from 4 to 20 comprehensive portal sections
- Added detailed console logging for troubleshooting

The browser will now visibly navigate through portals, ensuring
screenshots capture actual report data instead of landing pages.
```

## Verification Checklist

After running the report generation:

- [ ] Browser opens in headed mode (visible)
- [ ] Browser navigates to Entra portal
- [ ] Clicks through Billing > Licenses > All Products
- [ ] Captures license table screenshot
- [ ] Navigates to Security portal
- [ ] Clicks through Vulnerability Management menus
- [ ] Scrolls down pages to capture multiple sections
- [ ] Captures 20 total sections
- [ ] Screenshots show actual data, not landing pages
- [ ] Monthly Summary text is extracted
- [ ] All screenshots are saved to output directory
