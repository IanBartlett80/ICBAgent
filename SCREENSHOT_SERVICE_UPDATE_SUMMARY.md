## MCP Command Structure

### Standard Navigation Pattern
```javascript
{
  navigate: { 
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_navigate',
    params: { url: 'https://...' }
  },
  wait: { 
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for',
    params: { time: 5 }
  },
  screenshot: {
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot',
    params: { filename: '...', type: 'jpeg', fullPage: true }
  }
}
```

### Scroll Pattern
```javascript
{
  scroll: {
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_evaluate',
    params: { function: '() => { window.scrollBy(0, <amount>); }' }
  },
  waitAfterScroll: {
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_wait_for',
    params: { time: 3 }
  },
  screenshot: {
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_take_screenshot',
    params: { filename: '...', type: 'jpeg', fullPage: false }
  }
}
```

### Text Extraction Pattern
```javascript
{
  navigate: { ... },
  wait: { ... },
  snapshot: {
    tool: 'mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot',
    params: {}
  }
  // Then extract text from snapshot
}
```

## Special Handling Requirements

### 1. Top 10 Vulnerabilities (Section 6)
**Critical Requirement**: AI analysis must focus **ONLY** on the first 10 items in the recommendations table.

**Implementation**:
- Section includes `aiInstructions` property
- Flagged for special handling during AI analysis
- Report should detail each of the top 10 with remediation steps

### 2. Monthly Security Summary (Section 15)
**Critical Requirement**: Extract text content, do not rely on screenshot.

**Implementation**:
- Section includes `extractText: true` property
- Uses `mcp_playwright_browser_snapshot` instead of screenshot
- Text passed separately to AI analysis
- Text embedded directly in report

---

## Documentation Created

- Complete documentation for all 20 sections
- Detailed navigation steps for each
- MCP command examples
- Troubleshooting guide
- AI analysis instructions

### 2. **SCREENSHOT_MCP_QUICK_REFERENCE.md**
- At-a-glance table of all 20 sections

   - `setAuthenticationComplete()` - unchanged

2. **Screenshot Capture**
   - `captureAllPortalScreenshots()` - UPDATED
   - Returns instructions for 20 sections
   - Includes MCP command structure

3. **Completion Handling**

## Usage Example

```javascript
const PlaywrightServiceMCP = require('./services/playwright-screenshot-service-mcp.js');

// Initialize service
const screenshotService = new PlaywrightServiceMCP();
await screenshotService.initialize();

// Get instructions for capturing all screenshots
const instructions = await screenshotService.captureAllPortalScreenshots(
  (progress) => {
    console.log(`${progress.progress}% - ${progress.message}`);
  }
);

// Instructions object contains:
// - 20 portal definitions
// - MCP commands for each
// - Navigation steps
// - Scroll requirements
// - Special handling flags

// After MCP execution completes, mark as done:
const result = screenshotService.setAllScreenshotsComplete(
  screenshotPaths,  // Array of 19 screenshot paths
  {
    monthly_summary: extractedSummaryText  // Extracted text from section 15
  }
);

// Result includes all paths, metadata, and extracted text
```

**Issue**: Authentication timeout  
**Solution**: Increase authentication wait or check permissions

**Issue**: Monthly Summary text not extracted  
**Solution**: Verify snapshot captures Summary section, check text extraction logic

### Getting Help
1. Check service logs for detailed error messages
