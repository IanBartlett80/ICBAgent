# Zero Trust Assessment - Permission Approval Guide

## Overview

The ICB Agent Zero Trust Assessment feature now includes an intelligent permission approval system that prompts IT professionals when additional Microsoft Graph permissions are required during security assessments.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Permission Detection
When the Zero Trust Assessment encounters a permission error while collecting data, the system:
- ‚úÖ Automatically detects the specific permission requirement
- ‚úÖ Identifies the exact Microsoft Graph scopes needed
- ‚úÖ Pauses the assessment gracefully
- ‚úÖ Presents a user-friendly permission request dialog

### 2. Permission Request Dialog
The permission dialog provides:
- **Clear explanation** of what data is being accessed and why
- **Detailed permission list** with human-readable descriptions
- **Security information** about read-only access
- **Step-by-step approval process**
- **Technical details** for troubleshooting (expandable)

### 3. Streamlined Approval Process
IT professionals can:
1. **Review** the requested permissions in context
2. **Approve** permissions with a single click
3. **Complete** Microsoft consent in a new browser window
4. **Continue** assessment automatically upon return

## Permission Categories

### Identity Assessment Permissions
- `User.Read.All` - Read all user profiles and account information
- `Directory.Read.All` - Read directory data including users, groups, and organizational settings
- `Policy.Read.All` - Read conditional access and other security policies
- `Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess` - Read conditional access policies and their configurations

### Device Assessment Permissions
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All` - Read information about managed devices enrolled in Microsoft Intune
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All` - Read device compliance and configuration policies

### Application Assessment Permissions
- `Application.Read.All` - Read application registrations and service principals
- `Group.Read.All` - Read group information and membership details

### Infrastructure Assessment Permissions
- `RoleManagement.Read.Directory` - Read directory role assignments and definitions
- `Domain.Read.All` - Read verified domain information
- `Organization.Read.All` - Read organization profile and tenant information

## Security Considerations

### Read-Only Access
- ‚úÖ All permissions are **read-only**
- ‚úÖ No data modification or deletion capabilities
- ‚úÖ Assessment purposes only
- ‚úÖ Temporary access tokens

### Least Privilege Principle
- ‚úÖ Only requests permissions for data being assessed
- ‚úÖ Specific scopes for each assessment category
- ‚úÖ Minimal permission sets
- ‚úÖ Contextual permission requests

### Audit Trail
- ‚úÖ All permission requests are logged
- ‚úÖ User approval/denial tracked
- ‚úÖ Assessment context preserved
- ‚úÖ Compliance reporting available

## User Experience

### Before Permission Approval
```
üõ°Ô∏è Starting Zero Trust Assessment...
üìä Collecting assessment data...
üîí Additional permissions required for Conditional Access Policies
```

### Permission Dialog
```
üîê Additional Permissions Required
Zero Trust Assessment needs additional Microsoft Graph permissions

üìä Data Collection Request
Resource: Conditional Access Policies
Purpose: Security posture assessment and compliance evaluation

üîë Required Permissions
‚Ä¢ Policy.Read.All - Read conditional access and other security policies
‚Ä¢ Policy.ReadWrite.ConditionalAccess - Read conditional access policies and their configurations
‚Ä¢ Directory.Read.All - Read directory data including users, groups, and organizational settings

‚ÑπÔ∏è What This Means
These permissions allow the ICB Agent to read Conditional Access Policies information 
from your Microsoft 365 tenant for security assessment purposes. 
No data will be modified or deleted.

üöÄ Approval Process
1. Click "Approve Permissions" below
2. A new browser window will open for Microsoft consent
3. Review and approve the requested permissions
4. Return to this page - assessment will continue automatically
