# Manual Screenshot Capture System - User Guide

## Overview

The ICB Agent now uses a **manual screenshot capture system** with a floating overlay that guides you through capturing all 20 required sections for the Intelligent Customer Monthly Report. This approach replaces the previous automated navigation which was unreliable due to dynamic portal layouts.

## Key Features

### 1. **Windows Snipping Tool Style Region Selection**
- Drag to select specific regions of the screen
- Only captures what you select (not full page)
- Visual feedback with green border during selection

### 2. **Sequential Section Prompts**
- Guides you through all 20 sections in order
- Shows progress (e.g., "Section 5/20")
- Displays clear instructions for each section

### 3. **Floating Overlay UI**
- Always visible in top-right corner
- Shows current section information
- Portal name and navigation instructions
- Capture or Skip buttons

### 4. **Customer Name Integration**
- Required field in pre-flight modal
- Used in report filename: `CustomerName_Health_Report_Oct_2025.docx`
- Used in folder structure: `C:\ICBAgent\Monthly Reports\CustomerName\`

## How to Use

### Step 3: Manual Screenshot Capture

### Step 4: Report Generation

## Tips for Best Results

### Navigation Tips
- **Take your time** - No rush between sections (10 minute timeout per section)
- **Wait for content to load** - Ensure graphs/charts are fully rendered
- **Scroll if needed** - Make sure all important data is visible
- **Use portal search** - If you can't find a menu, use the search function

### Selection Tips
- **Select tightly** - Only capture the relevant content area
- **Avoid UI chrome** - Don't include unnecessary portal headers/navigation
- **Include context** - Make sure labels and legends are visible
- **Check before releasing** - Green border shows what will be captured

### Quality Tips
- **High resolution** - System captures at 90% JPEG quality
- **Clear visibility** - Ensure text is readable in your selection
- **Complete data** - Don't cut off tables or charts
- **Consistent style** - Try to keep similar framing for similar sections

## Troubleshooting

### "Customer Name is required" error
- **Solution**: Enter a customer/organization name in the pre-flight modal before clicking Generate Report

### Overlay doesn't appear
- **Solution**: Refresh the page and try again. Ensure JavaScript is enabled.

### Can't find a portal section
- **Solution**: Click "Skip" for that section. Report will still generate without it.
- **Note**: Some sections may not be available depending on customer's M365 licenses

### Selection not working
- **Solution**: 
  - Make sure you click "Capture Region" button first
  - Screen should dim with crosshair cursor
  - Click, drag, and release to select
  - Try refreshing browser if issue persists

### Screenshots look blurry
- **Solution**: 
  - Zoom out in browser (Ctrl + Mouse Wheel Down) to capture more area
  - Or zoom in for specific details
  - System captures at actual browser zoom level

### Authentication timeout
- **Solution**: 
  - You have 5 minutes to sign in
  - If timeout occurs, restart the report generation
  - Use correct customer tenant credentials (not ICB Solutions)

### Report generation fails
- **Check**:
  1. At least some screenshots were captured (not all skipped)
  2. Customer name was entered
  3. Browser didn't close during capture
  4. Internet connection stable during AI analysis

## Error Messages Fixed

### ‚úÖ "ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE: path must be string" - FIXED
- **Previous issue**: System tried to analyze text content without screenshot file
- **Fix**: Now skips vision analysis when screenshot path is undefined
- **Result**: Report generates successfully even if some screenshots are missing

## File Naming Convention

All files use the customer name you entered:

### Screenshots (in temp folder)
```
entra_licenses_1696123456789.jpg
vulnerability_dashboard_1696123456790.jpg
security_overview_1696123456791.jpg
...
```

### Word Document
```
CustomerName_Health_Report_October_2025.docx
```

### Folder Structure
```
C:\ICBAgent\
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Monthly Reports\
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ CustomerName\
